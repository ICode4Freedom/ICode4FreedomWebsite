Hi there! I'm Mike, and ICode4Freedom (corny I know). I'm a 24 Computer Science new grad now working in my first year as a Software Engineer. I have pretty generalized expertise being a new grad, from AI/ML to Web Dev (I learned Astro to make this website!), but my main expertise is in big data and process automation. I typically work in Python/C++.

On this blog, I'll mostly be posting about technology, book reviews, philosophy, and other topics I just feel like writing about. I want to use this blog for self expression mainly, and I hope people find that enjoyable!

To be honest, I'm nothing really special. I wasn't a 4.0 GPA student, I don't work in FAANG, I don't run 3 different startups with a $100m ARR, none of that. I'm just your average software bro whose lucky and thankful enough to get his first job, and is working hard to be successful.

Life has thrown me a lot of curveballs, given me many opportunities to learn/grow, and has also given me an equal amount of tests as an individual. I have a long list of successes, and an equally long list of failures. So I'm writing this blog because I think everyone's life has something to learn from, including my own.

So I hope you stick around and enjoy my blog! Thanks a lot for being here :)

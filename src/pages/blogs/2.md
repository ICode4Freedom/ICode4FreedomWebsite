<u><strong>PREFACE</strong></u>

Life can get really interesting really fast if you're averse to taking a chance on it.

Let me take you back to the start of 2025. My goal for the year was to graduate a semester early, and that meant cramming all of my classes of four semesters into essentially two. That meant taking six classes in the Spring and two classes in the Summer while also doing an internship for one elective credit. My Fall was looking to be a lot easier, as I'd be my last semester coasting to the finish line with my degree.

When Spring rolled around, I was ready. I woke up at 5am to get a good start to my day, started work at around 7am, and finished at around 5-6pm. I was highly diciplined and had a lot of time to solely focus on my academics. Even though it was hard, I held on and had one of the best semesters I've ever had in university. I was really proud of myself for working hard.

Now to mid-May, already a couple weeks into my Summer classes and my internship, it was a whole different beast. I was horribly busy, working 40 hours a week during my internship and about 30 hours a week split between two intensive, accelerated 6-week math classes. I was about one more Jira ticket or moved assignment deadline away from completely crashing out. It was rough and I was really worried about failing a class and having to take another semester.

Then I get a message. I forgot that at the end of the Spring semester, I sent a message to one of my professors, who happened to be the coordinator for the study abroad in Japan, asking about study abroad opportunities outside of the university or in grad school. His reply was late, but it was perfect timing.

We started messaging back and forth and I explained my situation. The Japanese program required that I took certain classes in order to go on the trip. I was fine with this, however, I needed to take required courses for my degree that weren't offered through the program. In my eyes, I this meant it was over. I would've had to take 7-8 classes and spend extra money to graduate. I would've been stressed and spread thin. I was crushed...

And then my professor said, "Don't worry about it, this is what I live for :)"

We spoke to all the professors from classes I needed, and we were able to make a hybrid schedule that dropped classes provided in the program, and allow me to take the classes I needed to graduate online. I was even given a small scholarship to pay for some overcharge credits. I was given the green light!

So now it was up to me. All I had to do now was send in my application. By this time it was June 4th, and the application was due June 5th. Everything was lined up and I could pay for the entire trip in full if I worked overtime during my internship. 

I was debating whether or not I'd take this leap and experience something new, or remain locked in my college apartment to finish out my degree.

It might seem like a no brainer, but it was really daunting. It would be my first time out of the country, and it would be halfway accross the entire world! This was going to be a really big life change and I knew it. I tried talking myself out of it because it would be expensive, but the voice in my head telling me I'd never get this experience again, studying abroad in university, spoke to me too loudly.

So I took the leap and didn't look back.

I sent in my application and was accepted the next day. I would be spending my last semester in Japan! I would miss my graduation walk, but I didn't care.

It was the exact kind of fire I needed at the time. I passed my Summer classes, started learning Japanese and worked all the overtime I could. My workload went up to about 100 hours a week spread between work, class, and Japanese. I turned into an absolute machine knowing that a new life experience was right around the corner, waiting for me in Japan.

So, how was the trip?

<u><strong>MY EXPERIENCE</strong></u>

Life changing.

I know that it's a meme to say that someone is going through a quarter life crisis if they go to Japan,
